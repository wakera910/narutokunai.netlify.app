        <p>19/08/2021 · for the entirety of the original naruto series, it seemed like sasuke and itachi were the only two living uchiha, and their hatred for one another was one of the strongest storylines in the series.itachi had seemingly killed the entire rest of the clan, leaving sasuke alive so that he could one day kill his brother.</p>
